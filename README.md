My final year project. An android application designed to deliver dynamic guided walks to tourists in Birmingham.

The application uses the mapbox API to deliver GPS navigation, along with a nearest neighbour algorithm to find the fastest route to each of the locations on the walk.

The database is ran on Firebase, with the jSoup webscraper used to deliver the information for each location
